  "description": "<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<u>This is just an auto-generated example! The information in this document maybe inaccurate!</u></p><p>This dataset contains intraoperative intracranial EEG (ECoG and, where applicable, SEEG) recordings from six patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing epilepsy surgery at the University Medical Center Utrecht. The data have been curated from clinical source recordings into the iEEG-BIDS specification and include multiple intraoperative situations (pre-resection, intermediate, and post-resection recordings), along with associated metadata to support reuse in research on epilepsy, brain networks, and methods development for iEEG processing.</p>\n",
  "purpose": "The dataset was created to provide a real-world example of how clinical intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from epilepsy surgery can be converted into the iEEG-BIDS standard, thereby promoting standardisation, transparency and reuse of clinical iEEG data. It is intended to support methodological research on BIDS workflows, validation of iEEG preprocessing and analysis pipelines, development of algorithms for seizure and event detection, and studies of effective connectivity and network properties in patients with focal epilepsy undergoing intraoperative monitoring.",

Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) and, where applicable, stereo-EEG (SEEG) recordings were obtained using subdural grids, strips and depth electrodes implanted over or within cortex suspected to contain the seizure onset zone. Recordings were performed during defined surgical situations (pre-resection, intermediate and post-resection), with sampling rates and amplifier settings chosen according to clinical protocols. The raw clinical recordings were retrospectively exported, pseudo-anonymised, organised into sessions, runs and tasks, and converted into the iEEG-BIDS specification using a documented workflow and accompanying scripts.",

For the intraoperative examples, electrode coordinates in some files are set to zero to satisfy de-identification requirements while preserving the structure of the metadata.
