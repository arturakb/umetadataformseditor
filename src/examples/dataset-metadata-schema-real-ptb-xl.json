  "description": "<p><strong>Note:</strong><u> This is just an auto-generated example! The information in this document may be inaccurate!</u></p><p><strong>PTB-XL</strong> is a large clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) dataset released on PhysioNet. It contains <strong>21,837</strong> ten-second 12-lead ECG recordings from <strong>18,885</strong> patients, collected in routine clinical practice and curated into a structured research database.</p><p>Each ECG recording is annotated with one or more ECG statements following the <strong>SCP-ECG</strong> standard. In total, the dataset includes <strong>71 ECG statements</strong> covering diagnostic, form, and rhythm information (e.g. myocardial infarction, ST/T changes, conduction disturbances, hypertrophy, and normal ECG). Diagnostic statements are organised hierarchically into <strong>5 superclasses</strong> and <strong>24 subclasses</strong> to support classification at different granularities.</p><p>The waveform data are stored in <strong>WFDB</strong> format at <strong>500 Hz</strong> sampling frequency with 16-bit precision and 1&nbsp;µV/LSB resolution, together with a downsampled <strong>100 Hz</strong> version for convenience. Rich accompanying metadata include demographic variables (age, sex, height, weight), infarction characteristics, ECG report text, signal quality indicators, and recommended cross-validation folds. The dataset is designed as a benchmark resource for <strong>automatic ECG interpretation</strong> and related machine-learning research.</p>",
  "purpose": "<h2>Primary Purpose</h2><p>The PTB-XL dataset was created to address two major limitations in automatic ECG interpretation research: the lack of <strong>large, freely accessible clinical ECG datasets</strong> and the lack of <strong>well-defined benchmark procedures</strong> for evaluating algorithms.</p><h2>Intended Uses</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Training and benchmarking</strong> of machine-learning and deep-learning models for multi-label ECG classification (diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements).</p></li><li><p><strong>Methodological research</strong> on robust ECG preprocessing, feature extraction, and representation learning for 12-lead ECG waveforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation of clinical decision-support algorithms</strong> for cardiovascular disease detection, including myocardial infarction, conduction disturbances, hypertrophy, and ST/T abnormalities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exploration of dataset characteristics</strong>, such as label hierarchies, multi-label co-occurrence patterns, and the impact of signal quality on diagnostic performance.</p></li></ul><p>The dataset is explicitly designed as a <strong>reference benchmark</strong> for reproducible research, with recommended cross-validation folds to enable fair comparison of algorithms across studies.</p>",
